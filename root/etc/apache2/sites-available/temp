Remember: This repo is replicating my live server setup. So, the README can't be focused on a single branch of the tree, know what I'm sayin? I'm skipping the bedrock server for now. I've copied and sanitized the system health check, the Wireguard settings, the automated backup cron job and script, the html/css for all that output, as well as the fastAPI endpoints that make them work.
